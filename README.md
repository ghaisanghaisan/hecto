My implementation of hecto from this [article](https://www.flenker.blog/hecto/)


What I learned so far:
- How to work with structs, traits, and implementations
- Discovered how to do basic work with terminals
- Understood the differences between &str and String
- Finally understood Result and Option. Don't know about box tho
- Still don't understand lifetimes
